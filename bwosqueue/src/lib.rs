//! The BWoS queue is a fast block-based work stealing queue for parallel processing.
//!
//! The BWoS queue is based on the [BBQ] (Block-based Bounded Queue) and is specially designed for the
//! workstealing scenario. Based on the real-world observation that the "stealing" operation is
//! rare and most of the operations are local enqueues and dequeues this queue implementation
//! offers a single [Owner] which can enqueue and dequeue without any heavy synchronization mechanisms
//! on the fast path. Concurrent stealing is possible and does not slow done the Owner too much.
//! This allows stealing policies which steal single items or in small batches.
//!
//! # Queue Semantics
//!
//! - The block-based design reduces the synchronization requirements on the fast-path
//!   inside a block and moves the heavy synchronization operations necessary to support
//!   multiple stealers to the slow-path when transitioning to the next block.
//! - The producer (enqueue) may not advance to the next block if the consumer or a stealer
//!   is still operating on that block. This allows the producer to remove producer-consumer/stealer
//!   synchronization from its fast-path operations, but reduces the queue capacity by
//!   at most one block.
//! - Stealers may not steal from the same block as the consumer. This allows the consumer
//!   to remove consumer-stealer synchronization from its fast-path operations, but means
//!   one block is not available for stealing.
//! - Consumers may "take-over" the next block preventing stealers from stealing in that
//!   block after the take-over. Stealers will still proceed with already in-progress steal
//!   operations in this block.
//! - This queue implementation puts the producer and consumer into a shared Owner struct,
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//!  todo
//!
//! [BBQ]: https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc22/presentation/wang-jiawei
//!
//! # Todo:
//! - Instead of const generics we could use a boxed slice for a dynamically sized array.
//!   The performance impact be benchmarked though, since this will result in multiple operations
//!   not being able to be calculated at compile-time anymore.
